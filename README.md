# Tekever - React Challenge

This project contains the challenge from Tekever where I should hit some requirements, all of then can be found [here](https://github.com/R31N4LD0/tekever/blob/master/public/Tekever%20-%20React%20Challenge.pdf), but basically We should have a main page showing a list of all pokemon, with pagination. When a pokemon is clicked another page should open with the details of this one and also It can be add to a favorited list (in browsers' localStorage). In the last page all the favorited pokemon should be listed. 

## Some more detailed infos
The items in the section 'Functional requirements' included in the [PDF](https://github.com/R31N4LD0/tekever/blob/master/public/Tekever%20-%20React%20Challenge.pdf) was developed and can be used in this final version.\

You'll need `yarn` or `npm` to run the project localy, but from now on We will cover all the steps using only `yarn`.

The app uses React version `17.0.2`, and some 'addons' like `node-sass`, `axios`, `react-bootstrap` and `react-router-dom` to get the things more easy.


## Running the project

After You clone this project, just run the instalation:

### `yarn install`

And than, start it with:

### `yarn start`

After that just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to see the main page.\
When You edit some file, the app will be aotomatically reloaded in the browser.

The command `yarn build` will generate the final app folder inside the folder `build`.\
